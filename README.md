# E-commerce-Website-Certification-Testing
This repository contains all the necessary resources for the certification testing of a new "Express Checkout" feature on a mock e-commerce platform. The project focuses on verifying the end-to-end functionality of the shopping cart, the new one-click payment process, and its secure integration with a third-party payment gateway.
